# Definitive AI: Open Source Contributions

## Overview

This repository contains open-source contributions to the Definitive AI project, a cutting-edge tool for automating AI agent development. Our goal is to enhance and extend the capabilities of AI agent frameworks, particularly Langchain, with new agent types, selection algorithms, and other useful additions.

These open-source components complement the full Definitive AI suite, which includes a powerful web-based AI Agent Generator. Visit our [main website](https://www.definitive-ai.com) to learn more about our complete offering.

## Key Features

### 1. New Agent Types

We've developed and implemented several new agent types to expand the versatility of AI agents. These include:

- [Brief description of new agent type 1]
- [Brief description of new agent type 2]
- [Add more as needed]

### 2. Agent Selection Algorithm

Our innovative algorithm helps in selecting the most appropriate agent for different situations, optimizing performance and efficiency. Key features include:

- Context-aware selection
- Performance-based optimization
- Adaptive learning capabilities

### 3. Langchain Enhancements

We've contributed several improvements and additions to the Langchain framework:

- [Brief description of enhancement 1]
- [Brief description of enhancement 2]
- [Add more as needed]

## Connection to Definitive AI Agent Generator

The components in this repository are designed to work seamlessly with the Definitive AI Agent Generator, our web-based tool for rapid AI agent development. While the Agent Generator offers a user-friendly interface for creating AI agents from process documentation or interviews, this open-source library provides additional functionalities and customizations for developers who want to extend their agents or integrate them into more complex systems.
